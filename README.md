# Telecom Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy

## Business Problem
ConnectTel Communications Ltd is facing increasing customer churn, especially among high-value postpaid and heavy data users. This project builds a machine learning model to predict churn and design proactive retention strategies.

## Objective
- Predict customers likely to churn
- Identify key churn drivers
- Recommend targeted retention actions

## Dataset
Customer-level telecom data including:
- Demographics
- Plan & tenure details
- Usage behaviour
- Billing & payment history
- Complaints & service experience

## Approach
1. Data validation & cleaning
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature engineering (usage drop, bill shock, complaints)
4. ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
5. Model evaluation (Recall, ROC-AUC)
6. Business-driven retention recommendations

## Key Insights
- Usage drop and frequent complaints are strong churn indicators
- Bill shock significantly increases postpaid churn
- High-value customers require proactive retention

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Outcome
The solution enables early identification of at-risk customers and supports targeted retention strategies to improve customer lifetime value.
